## Description
#### Here is the full pay distribution of accountants and allowing users to investigate each data point.

- Created scattered plot, calculated fields and parameters to highlight the growth of the employee in terms of their position and pay in different years.

- Used Analytics pane to display the reference line which shows the pay of the employee falls in which percentile 10, 50 or 90. This vizualization also shows in which year the employee was promoted and their pay in the respective year.

- Pivoted the wide data file into a long data file. We can see that California has higher pay in all the distributional metric than U.S, and San Francisco stands out as it has much higher pay than US and California.

- This viz now shows a benchmark overlaid directly on top of the distribution for pay for employees of the city of san francisco. We can easily draw insights into how pay at our company may compare to those in the area. For example, we see that the minimum pay for the city of San Francisco was $72000 in 2019 and this is higher than 25 percentile of the area we also see that the maximum pay was $14200 which is less than the 90 percentile of the surrounding area. As a result, the lowest-paid city employees make more than their counterparts while the highest-paid city employees make less than their counterparts. However, we can see that the 50th percentile of the pay for accountants in the city of San Francisco is roughly equal to 75 percentile pay for the accountants in the surrounding area. This means that the median employee is making a really good wage.

- Created a waterfall chart and added subgroup calculations.
The following viz shows the percentage and amount of Base pay, Overtime pay, Other Pay, Benefits, and their total as  Total Pay and Benefits according to the job titles selected. This vizualization also show how the various job titles pay are different from others.
