# Tableau-San-Francisco-Payroll
### The projects show different visualizations based on San Francisco payroll data of employees. I have used Calculated fields, Parameters, pages card, Grouping, pivoting, overlay multple data in a single data source, and many more functions in this project.

Here's how my dashboard look like:

#### Full pay distribution of accountants and allowing users to investigate each data point.

Created scattered plot, calculated fields and parameters to highlight the employee and their position in different years.
